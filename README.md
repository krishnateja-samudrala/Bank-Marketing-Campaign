# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of a banking institution's marketing campaign dataset to predict term deposit subscriptions using machine learning techniques.

## Business Problem
The business objective is to identify key factors that influence a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit. By understanding these drivers, the bank can tailor its marketing strategy to maximize conversion rates.

## Data
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's [Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). It contains 41,188 observations with 20 features:

- *Client Attributes* (age, job, marital status, education, housing loan status, personal loan status, default history): These features describe characteristics of the clients that may influence their propensity to subscribe to a term deposit. Analyzing these can shed light on which customer demographics are associated with higher conversion rates.

- *Communication* (contact method, contact month, contact day of month): Details on how and when clients were contacted during the campaign. This can reveal optimal communication strategies for future marketing.

- *Campaign Info* (number of contacts, days since last contact, number of contacts prior to campaign): Insights into the intensity and recency of campaign outreach for each client. This provides indicators of effective contact frequency and sequencing.

- *Economic Context* (employment variation rate, consumer price index, consumer confidence index, Euribor 3m rate): Macroeconomic trends that reflect the prevailing economic climate during the campaign. Useful for accounting for external factors influencing client behavior.

- *Target* (Term deposit subscription): Binary variable indicating if the client subscribed to a term deposit (1) or not (0). This is the label the models aim to predict. 

## Methods
The analysis methodology consists of:

- *Exploratory Data Analysis*: Conducted univariate analysis of feature distributions and multivariate analysis of correlations and scatterplots to understand relationships in the data.

- *Data Cleaning*: Handled missing values through imputation techniques leveraging correlations between features. Encoded categorical variables via one-hot encoding and hashing to convert them into model-usable numerical variables.

- *Feature Engineering*: Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction to avoid overfitting. Used Chi-Square test for feature selection to remove irrelevant variables and improve model performance. 

- *Preprocessing*: Split data into train and test sets for modeling. Handled class imbalance via undersampling of the majority class to prevent bias.

- *Modeling*: Compared performance of Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks models. Also explored ensemble techniques to improve predictions.

- *Evaluation*: Used Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC, and Log Loss to evaluate and compare models. Selected best model based on these metrics.

## Key Findings
- SVM achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 0.91 due to its ability to find the optimal hyperplane.
- Hashing outperformed one-hot encoding for encoding categorical variables.
- Class balancing and feature selection significantly boosted model performance.
- Client's age, default history, housing loan status were top drivers of term deposit subscription.
